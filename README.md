Blueprint is an AI UI builder that turns ideas into structured, production-ready interfaces — not random mockups, not throwaway components.

It focuses on real-world app architecture, clean component structure, and developer-friendly output that you can actually ship.

---

## Why Blueprint?

Most AI UI tools optimize for visuals.  
Blueprint optimizes for engineering reality.

- Predictable component structure  
- Clean layouts aligned with modern design systems  
- Output meant to live inside real codebases  
- Built for iteration, not screenshots  

If you care about maintainability, extensibility, and clarity, this is for you.

## Features

### Idea → Interface
Describe what you want. Blueprint generates structured UI layouts, not pixels.

### Production-ready output
Clean components, sensible layout hierarchy, reusable patterns.

### Modern stack
Built on Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, and modern tooling.

### Design-system friendly
Works well with shadcn/ui and component-driven workflows.

### Extensible by default
Generated UI is meant to be edited, evolved, and owned by developers.

## What Blueprint Is (and Isn’t)

### Blueprint is:
- An AI-assisted UI builder for real apps  
- A productivity multiplier for frontend development  
- A starting point, not a black box  

### Blueprint is not:
- A no-code toy  
- A design mockup generator  
- A locked-in visual editor  

You own the code. Always.
